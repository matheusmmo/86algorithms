# 86 days of algorithms

This repository was created to store all the code for the 86 days of algorithms. The idea here is to solve at least one algorithm per day for 86 days. I created 86 algorithms as a way to challange myself to solve problems and learn something new every day.

The algorithms are usually copied from Hacker Rank, you can find a link to the problem along with my comments in the first lines of each solution.

Day 1 - [Sparse Arrays](1/sparse_arrays.py)
Day 2 - [Algorithmic Crush](2/algorithmic_crush.py)
